## Senstiment-analysis
In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model to analyze and classify sentiments expressed in tweets. The project involved several technologies to achieve accurate and insightful results. I utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words. For the modeling phase, I employed various machine learning algorithms and neural network architectures, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers, to effectively capture the nuances of language. Additionally, I used libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the models. The dataset consisted of a large number of tweets, which were annotated with sentiment labels to train the model. The final output was a sentiment classifier capable of categorizing tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing valuable insights into public opinions and trends on social media.
